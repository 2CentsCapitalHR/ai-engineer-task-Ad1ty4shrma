Obligations: Annual Accounts and Filings

All registered entities in ADGM are required to comply with ongoing filing obligations to ensure they remain in good standing.

Key Obligations:
- Annual Accounts: Companies must prepare and file annual accounts with the Registration Authority. The accounts must provide a true and fair view of the company's financial position.
- Filing Deadline: Accounts must be filed within the period prescribed by the Companies Regulations. Typically, this is within 9 months of the company's financial year-end.
- Auditing Requirements: Depending on the type and size of the company, the annual accounts may need to be audited by an ADGM-registered auditor. Small private companies may be exempt from the audit requirement if they meet certain criteria.
- Annual Return: Companies must also file an annual confirmation statement (annual return) confirming that the information held on the public register is accurate and up-to-date.

Failure to comply with these obligations can result in penalties, including fines and the potential striking-off of the company from the register. It is the responsibility of the company's directors to ensure these filings are completed accurately and on time.
